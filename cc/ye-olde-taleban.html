      <h1>Hello Augustinas</h1>
      <p>Thank you for your hard and dedicated work in 2020.<br />There is no doubt in my mind, that you have helped in making Addo the great product and service it is!</p>
      <p>I love your humour! Please, more of that. Didn't know that testing could be that much fun!<br />I hope that 2021 will see you do more automation in testing.<br />And hey! You'll get your own slave ... Now, which dictator do you want to be? :-)</p>
      <p>I wish you and your loved ones a merry christmas &amp; a happy new year!</p>
