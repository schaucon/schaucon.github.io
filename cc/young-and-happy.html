      <h1>Hello Julius</h1>
      <p>Thank you for your hard and dedicated work in 2020.<br />There is no doubt in my mind, that you have helped in making Addo the great product and service it is!</p>
      <p>You've done a hell of job on the custom form in 2020. I really look forward to get you back on the team!<br />2021 will hopefully see us re-implementing WebAdmin + Signing Portal in a much better look'n'feel.<br />You are very much needed to make this happen! Thanks for sticking around despite the custom forms! :-)</p>
      <p>I wish you and your loved ones a merry christmas &amp; a happy new year!</p>
      <p class="signed-off">~ Brian</p>
