      <h1>Hello Karolis</h1>
      <p>Thank you for your hard and dedicated work in 2020.<br />There is no doubt in my mind, that you have helped in making Addo the great product and service it is!</p>
      <p>The way you analyze and deduce on data is really outstanding (particular on the SQL problems).<br />Besides being an awesome coder you also seem to be an awesome "systems-guy".<br />Keep on doing that - you're invaluable to the team and product!</p>
      <p>I wish you and your loved ones a merry christmas &amp; a happy new year!</p>
      <p class="signed-off">~ Brian</p>
