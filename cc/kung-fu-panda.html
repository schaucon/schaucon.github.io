      <h1>Hello Aleksandr</h1>
      <p>Thank you for your hard and dedicated work in 2020.<br />There is no doubt in my mind, that you have helped in making Addo the great product and service it is!</p>
      <p>I really enjoy our grooming session - they are fun as well as instructive.<br />I am thrilled that you "volunteered" (ahem) to become the grandfather of the team :-)<br />I have no doubts that you're the right choice and I look forward to our continued cooperation.</p>
      <p>I wish you and your loved ones a merry christmas &amp; a happy new year!</p>
      <p class="signed-off">~ Brian</p>
